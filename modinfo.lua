This mod intended to be used as a template for you to create your own shell bell songs, then spawn them ingame!
Please look in the mod files and create your own song file inside the "scripts/My Songs" folder.
If you'd like, you can refer to the example song files for help. Also see the modmain for functions you can use that may be helpful.]]
